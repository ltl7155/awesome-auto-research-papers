## Background

It is estimated that researchers spend much of their time on tasks that are not directly relevant to idea development, paper writing, or conducting experiments. With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), it is now possible for LLM-based agents to take over these peripheral efforts, significantly improving research efficiency.

This repository primarily focuses on papers that explore and advance such automated research initiatives.
